# PowerBI-Bookmarks

When you edit a report in Power BI Desktop and the Power BI service, you can add report bookmarks to capture the current state of a report page. Bookmarks save the current filters and slicers, cross-highlighted visuals, sort order, and so on. When others view your report, they can get back to that exact state by selecting your saved bookmark.
